Because of human activity, urban areas are more susceptible to introductions of exotic fauna; however, there have been no investigations on the efficacy of these hypotheses on exotic species in urban areas. Therefore, six study sites will be established in both metropolitan areas of Baltimore, Maryland and London, England.

The city too, can be considered as an open system. Its municipal boundaries are clear but its existence dependent on a continuous flow of materials, energy, information and people, in and out of the system. The city receives its resources from great distances and if we think about the city and its resources as an ecosystem, we should hold that this urban-ecosystem is equal to the whole biosphere. This is one of reasons that the influences of the urban settlement, despite its increasingly severe consequences, are in some way abstract for most of the urban population. The new understanding of the world, demands changes  in  environmental education, which needs to concentrate on the urban  population, educating it to manage its ecosystem wisely.\r\nThis poster deals with developing a curriculum for urban-environmental education. The basic idea of this curriculum is to heighten ecological thinking in the urban residents. Thus helping develop awareness of the dilemmas that are growing between man\'s activity and his environment and understanding of his role in the system. Through self and cooperative inquiry of those dilemmas, focusing on the question: \"How can I improve the situation?\" the student is supposed to develop a sense of power to influence positively his environment. Consequently he learn to see himself not just as part of the system, but as an observers who can analyze the system, recognize dilemmas and problems, suggest solutions to improve his environment and above all feel a sense of responsibility to put these ideas into practice.

At each of eight sites distributed across diverse biomes throughout the U.S., we are performing tracer-level 15N-nitrate addition experiments in 9 streams: 3 reference, 3 agricultural and 3 urban (for a total of 72 streams).  Each experiment consists of a 24-h addition of 15N-nitrate and longitudinally distributed measurements of 15N in water and in various benthic organic matter pools to determine in-situ rates of nitrification, assimilatory uptake of nitrate, and denitrification in each stream. We will use our experimental results to develop a general, process-based model of nitrate retention in stream reaches.  We then will extend our results to much larger spatial scales by combining our stream model with GIS-based information on hydrography and land use to predict nitrate retention in a 5th or 6th order river basin at each of the eight study sites.  We will test these predictions with synoptic field measurements of stream nitrate concentrations within each basin.

In a small, low relief stream in one watershed (496 hectares), which is fed almost exclusively by the surrounding sandy soil aquifer, the stream nitrate concentrations are considerably lower (1-2mg N L-1) under base flow conditions. Sediment denitrification is thought to remove substantial nitrate from the discharging groundwater. Heterogeneity of denitrification rates in near stream sediments is a consequence of zones of rapid decline in redox potential, associated with the presence of DOC and nitrate. Also, denitrification has been shown to be temperature sensitive. To explore this heterogeneity, vertical and horizontal gradients of nitrate levels, DOC, oxygen, and denitrification potential rates (acetylene block method) were measured in intact cores collected from the streambed and banks. In spring and summer, potential rates were adequate to account for the observed loss of nitrate from the discharging groundwater despite this heterogeneity observed in the sediments.

Sawgrass above ground biomass was calculated in two sites from February 2002 to August 2003 by bimonthly measuring three non-destructive m2 plots. Our biomass model predicts that the three main physiological traits responsible for sawgrass biomass are culm diameter at the base, flower height, and sum of the length of the leaves squared. Our model suggests that during this time period the average plot contains 220 gdw/m2. Also within each plot, three sawgrass plants were chosen and there leaves were  individually tagged as they emerged from the culm with small colored bands and counted bimonthly, allowing for each leaf to be tracked throughout its lifetime.  From these data we calculated leaf mortality, and sloughing rates. The average leaf lived approximately 4.5 months, and remained on the plant for an additional 7 months until sloughing off. The decomposition process was estimated using a litter bag experiment. The experiment was set to manipulate the decomposition cycle of sawgrass leaves, meaning first when the leaves die and remain attached to the plant (dry treatment), and then when the leaves are sloughed off by the plant (wet treatment). Litter bags for the dry treatment were attached to the periphery of a mesocosm above the water surface, and litter bags that experienced the wet treatment were placed on the soil surface. Preliminary results show that sawgrass leaves that were subjected to the dry treatment decompose at .0600 %/day and leaves that experience the wet treatment decompose at .1200 %/day. Essentially for sawgrass, its decomposition cycle acts as a �two step heat sink� by removing biomass from the plant and reallocating this lost biomass into the DOM pool.

Our results indicate no strong effects of mycorrhizal symbiosis on grasshopper feeding or development. Feeding levels on mycorrhizal versus non-mycorrhizal plants in microcosms did not differ significantly. Very few factors of grasshopper development were affected by mycorrhizal responsiveness of the host plant, and more frequently, developmental differences were based on natural feeding specificity (i.e. grass versus forb). Insect feeding levels on mycorrhizal plants were higher than on fungicide-treated plants in field transects. Mycorrhizal symbiosis positively affected plant re-growth following herbivory.

Total fAPAR is but a single biogeophysical variable describing a canopy.  We demonstrate here the advantages of the Advanced Vegetation Index Suite (AVIS), a new ensemble of indices that provides complementary but distinct views of the vegetated landscape.

Three ideas motivate the use of the AVIS: (1) plant canopy status is not well represented by a single biogeophysical variable, (2) different questions about vegetation require different, though related, answers, and (3) optimizing an index to retrieve a specific biogeophysical variable will enhance the robustness of that retrieval.

Insect frass (feces) is an appealing candidate because up to 86% of the leaf nitrogen consumed by the herbivore ends up in frass and the nitrogen is in labile forms.  Herbivore-mediated changes in N distribution may affect above- and belowground trophic systems and carbon (C) distribution.  Because nitrogen is often a limiting nutrient in forest systems and carbon often provides the energy source for nitrogen transformations, understanding the mechanisms behind an insect herbivore-mediated transfer of nitrogen from terrestrial to aquatic components of a watershed is important.  We initiated a replicated mini-ecosystem experiment to test three hypotheses that frass from canopy herbivores contributes to 1) increases in soil nitrogen, 2) nitrogen export as dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), and 3) an increase in soil respiration due to microbial oxidation of frass carbon.

Cladium BPP estimates should reveal seasonal patterns, variation along the salinity gradient of the ecotone, variation between the sloughs, and nutrient enrichment responses. BPP values should be relatively lower in Cladium sampled from the southern sites due to elevated salinity levels. Similarly, Shark River Slough should exhibit relatively lower BPP than Taylor Slough due to the increased P availability in that slough.

A cloning strategy has been developed that would allow genomic DNA that has been cut with I-CeuI to be inserted into pSuperPhyloBAC.  Due to the high degree of conservation in bacterial rRNA operons, this will allow for the creation of a unique BAC library in which each clone would contain a partial 23S rRNA gene and a complete 16S rRNA gene.  This library will allow for rapid screening of clones to isolate those containing DNA from microbial groups of interest along with genes indicating their physiological potential.  This library will allow us to begin to bridge the gap between phylogeny and function in an environment with few members in pure culture.', 'Michigan State University', 'Friday Evening', 'Saturday  ', NULL, '35.9.124.43', '002', NULL, '2003-07-10 12:55:00', '2003-09-03 15:05:00', 'KBS', NULL, 'YES'),

Freshwater transit time estimates from simple steady-state box models were very similar to flushing times but depended on river flow. As river discharge increases from 185 to 538 m3 s-1, flushing times decrease from 7.2 to 2.7 d. When box models were used to simulate both the movement of tracer within the estuary and its rate of removal, it moved toward an area 4-6 km upstream of the mouth, where it remained centered as overall removal continued. Movement toward this zone was observed regardless of flow rate or the point of tracer introduction, suggesting that this area could be a slowly flushing node in the Altamaha River estuary. Maximum exposure to tracer, measured as the amount of time that concentration exceeds a given threshold, depends on where in the estuary tracer is released.

Beighley , J. M. Melack , T. Dunne2\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nTo investigate the impacts of urbanization and climatic fluctuations on the magnitude and variability of streamflow in a Mediterranean climate, the HEC-HMS rainfall-runoff model was used to simulate streamflow for the 14-year period (9/1/1988 to 8/31/2002) in the Atascadero Creek watershed (50 km2) located along the southern coast of California for land use conditions in 1929, 1998, and 2050.  Atascadero Creek is a mountainous coastal watershed, with the recent 14-year period having a range of climatic conditions (i.e., El Ni�o and La Ni�a).  A Geographic Information System was used to delineate, divide the watershed into sub-areas and determine modeling parameters.  The HEC-HMS model was calibrated using two USGS stream gauges located within the watershed and rainfall from eight gauges in and around the watershed.  The percentage of watershed area classified as urban in 1929, 1998, and 2050 is 8, 38, and 52 percent, respectively.  Urbanization is shown to increase peak discharges and runoff volume while decreasing streamflow variability.  In all cases, the 14-year distribution of streamflow is highly skewed, with the maximum 10 days of flow from an average El Ni�o year producing 10 to 15 percent of the total 14-year discharge compared to an average La Ni�a year producing only 2 to 3 percent in 10 days.  Regardless of land use and climatic conditions, the annual distribution of streamflow is dominated by only a few winter rainfall events, with the percentage of annual runoff occurring in 1 day ranging from 22 to 52 percent.  The increase in urban land use from 1929 to 1998 is more than twice the projected increase from 1998 to 2050.  However, the increases in peak discharges and runoff volume for both land use change scenarios are similar because of the spatial distribution of the projected future urbanization within the watershed.', 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Friday Evening', 'Saturday  ', NULL, '128.111.111.186', '122', NULL, '2003-07-10 14:26:00', '2003-09-03 13:46:00', 'SBC', NULL, 'YES'),

The differential disturbance gradients represented on the KBS LTER site are likely to influence A. glycines population regulation via two mechanisms.  First, 14 years of differential management on the KBS LTER site have created differences in generalist natural enemy assemblages that may regulate the ability of this invasive herbivore to successfully colonize these habitats via top-down influences.  Second, by altering soil and nutrient conditions, treatment regimes may alter host plant phenology and nutritional quality through bottom�up effects that may influence A. glycines intrinsic rate of increase.

In this study, source waters and flowpaths of streamflow were determined using isotopic and geochemical tracers during the snowmelt runoff season in 1996 at two sub-catchments at Green Lakes Valley, Colorado Front Range. A two-component hydrograph separation using delta18O indicates that new water (82%) dominated streamflow at the 8-ha Martinelli catchment, while old water (64%) dominated streamflow at the 220-ha Green Lake 4 (GL4) catchment. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed for the streamflow data using correlation matrix of 8 conservative tracers. A rank analysis indicates that two U subspaces appear to fit the streamflow data at both Martinelli and GL4 catchments, implying that mixing of three end-members is sufficient to form streamflow chemistry. Without using compositions of measured end-members, variance of streamflow data that could be explained by three ideal end-members under two subspaces was computed using eigenvectors of the PCA for all tracers. The variance ratio is defined as �theoretical determinant�, as opposed to �practical determinant� using measured end-members. By using compositions of three measured end-members in end-member mixing analysis (EMMA), three flowpaths were identified. Using the flowpath results, the streamflow data were reproduced. Practical determinant matches the theoretical determinant reasonably well at both catchments for all tracers except delta18O. The flowpath results indicate that surface flow and subsurface flow accounted on average for about 50% at the Martinelli catchment.

Originally believed to be the sole result of strong salinity gradients present in these systems, recent research suggests that these patterns are the combined result of species-specific stress tolerance and competitive ability to acquire limiting nutrients.  This research, however, has focused on saltmarshes with little work in upstream, oligohaline marshes.  Oligohaline marshes are inherently more complex than their downstream neighbours since nutrient availability and salinity fluctuates on seasonal and tidal scales.   We conducted factorial fertilization studies within oligohaline and salt marshes at the PIE LTER which show that the dominant macrophyte in each system responds to different limiting nutrients (nitrogen in saltmarshes and phosphorus in oligohaline marshes).  This fact further complicates possible controls on macrophyte zonation in oligohaline systems where both brackish and saltmarsh species co-exist.  To investigate how nutrients and stress tolerance control zonation within oligohaline marshes we employed reciprocal transplants nested within a factorial N+P fertilization experiment.  In addition, we analysed samples of the two dominant co-occurring species for osmolyte concentrations to assess the importance of stress tolerance in determining which nutrient limits production.  Our results indicate that species-specific responses to nutrient additions exist, suggesting that both nitrogen and phosphorus locally control production.  The reciprocal response, however, was stimulated by fertilization and the brackish species performed significantly better when transplanted and fertilized with its preferred nutrient than its saltmarsh neighbour.

The general salt marsh zonation paradigm is that stress tolerance and competition combine to drive vegetation patterns within a single marsh.  However, it is unclear if that paradigm can be applied along an estuarine gradient.  Abiotic and biotic influences on Spartina growth were investigated through species removal experiments and reciprocal transplant studies coupled with neighbor removal treatments.  Preliminary results indicate that the removal of neighbors does not significantly change plant growth parameters over time.  However, S. alterniflora presence increased in all treatments over the course of two growing seasons, suggesting that competition for available space and long-term drought conditions may be controlling factors influencing observed field distributions in this moderate salinity zone.  Results also indicate that salinity is a dominant controlling factor and that neighbor presence inhibits growth of both species regardless of transplant location.  We interpret these results to suggest that abiotic and biotic treatments produce an interactive impact on Spartina performance, creating a hierarchy of treatment importance with salinity as the primary control and plant interactions as a secondary influence.  Perturbations, such as the anticipated reductions in freshwater inflow as a result of limited groundwater resources in coastal Georgia, will cause increased penetration of salt water upstream.

In spite of its relevance and sensitivity to external factors, few chemical studies have been carried out to characterize floc material, and even fewer on its organic chemistry. In this study, a molecular marker approach was used to assess the origin, transport and fate of OM in floc along the Taylor Slough and Shark River Slough of Everglades National Park, Florida. For this purpose, floc deposits, surface soil/sediments and plants were collected and analyzed for their lipid biomarkers and pigment composition. Hydrocarbons, fatty acids, alcohols, ketones, terpenoids and other lipid classes were identified. Both biomass-specific biomarker compounds and geochemical proxies were used for source assessments. Pigment composition was used as a chemotaxonomic tool. Our results showed, that the OM in floc is mainly derived from the dominant vegetation at a particular location, i.e., floc material was mainly influenced by periphyton and sawgrass derived in freshwater marshes. On the other hand, there is a much higher input of mangrove-derived organic matter in the floc of salt marsh areas where mangrove forests predominate.

All three lakes contained O. virilis as the native crayfish, and were invaded by O. propinquus prior to 1970. In addition, O. rusticus were detected in Trout Lake in 1978.

Crayfish populations grew over time in Big Muskellunge Lake and Trout Lake, but remained at low levels in Allequash Lake. Multivariate analysis of fish communities in the three lakes showed that the Trout and Big Muskellunge fish communities were more variable than the Allequash fish community. In particular benthic fishes had become less abundant through time, and predatory fishes more abundant. Although O. propinquus abundance was lower than O. rusticus abundance, O. propinquus appeared to be affecting the Big Muskellunge fish community in fashions similar to what was seen in Trout Lake. Temporal dynamics of recruitment and year class formation of several species were correlated with crayfish abundance in Trout Lake. Recruitment in Big Muskellunge Lake appeared unaffected by crayfish, except for some centrarchid species. There was no apparent relationship between crayfish and recruitment in Allequash Lake.

We tested the ability of multi-date LANDSAT imagery to detect cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), an annual cool season grass originally from Asia and Europe that has spread throughout much of western North America and dramatically altered many ecosystems in these areas.  Cheatgrass displays early seasonal development compared to most native species.  By comparing ground measurements of plant species cover with spectral response at multiple times throughout the growing season, we quantified the extent to which this phenological difference can facilitate cheatgrass detection.  Using a model selection approach to determine the best transformation of the spectral data and the best statistical relationship between spectral response and ground observations, we found a significant relationship between spectral response and cheatgrass abundance (R2 = 0.647).  This relationship indicates that cheatgrass detection is possible with multi-spectral imagery, and could be used to create cheatgrass distribution maps.

Variation in NPP was explained in large part by standing crop, which decreased at all sites in the fall when nutrient concentrations decreased and storm activity increased.

Birch in most studies showed no nutrient limitation, but increased growth was reported after a thinning treatment was applied. In white spruce stands, the trees showed growth increases for 28 years after the combined thinning and fertilization treatments were applied. Annual low-level fertilization in the LTER sites started to show significant growth increases 10 years after the fertilization treatments were started. The drought treatments decreased growth on the floodplain sites with relatively little change in upland sites. \r\n\r\nThe complexity of ecosystem dynamics across the landscape is related to a differential structure and interaction of the process limiting factors. Fertilization may only increase tree growth if other major limiting factors (such as moisture) are satisfied. So a direct change in that factor, like irrigation in a dry environment, should increase growth up to the limit set by the next environmental factor, say nitrogen. However a change in the potential amplitude of a limiting factor, like thinning a forest stand to reduce the total water utilization on a site (an indirect change related to the limiting factor availability), may not augment the control of growth with comparable effectiveness that would be observed by irrigation (a direct change in the limiting factor availability). In the case of a forest stand a large number of growth limiting factors could be diminished as a result of thinning. Factors like nutrient availability would be increased as a result of reduced competition, greater site utilization by the remaining individual trees, and possibly increased nutrient turnover in the soil environment.

We used historic aerial photography to document geomorphic changes resulting from the construction of a greenbelt along Indian Bend Wash, Scottsdale, AZ, in the early 1970&#8217;s.  Catchment land use shifted from prehistoric agriculture (14th C) to desert and again to agricultural fields in the early 20th C.  Beginning in 1955, suburban development has expanded from the mouth to headwaters of the wash, followed by greenway creation. This development has produced a shift in vegetation from desert scrub and mesquite bosques to a community dominated by low grasses and widely spaced trees.  The geomorphic modifications of the floodplain interact with catchment-wide land use changes to alter sediment transport and deposition, spatial and temporal patterns of nitrogen storage, and vegetative community dynamics.

Ecological and physiological interactions between the co-occurring decomposer groups may alter the fate of vascular plant-derived OM in estuarine ecosystems.  We studied  bacterial-fungal (B-F) interactions using integrated biogeochemical and molecular approaches to determine how those interactions are manifested and whether they affect the decomposition of vascular plant material in the salt marsh. We used two types of laboratory microcosm systems and conducted manipulative field studies of decaying plant material to investigate microbial interactions on decaying Spartina leaves from the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER field site.  Results of one microcosm experiment suggest that fungi alone degrade significantly more Spartina than in combination with bacteria or when bacteria were present alone.  In addition, two to three times more detrital carbon was routed to DOC rather than to CO2 if fungi were present alone.  Another other microcosm experiment suggested that  a dominant fungus released small quantities of fine particulate OM, highly labile DOC, and high levels of nitrogen-rich soluble material from Spartina blades when separated from bacteria.  Finally, field experiments show that manipulating the fungal community on decaying Spartina may affect the composition of the co-occurring bacterial community.

Marine macrophytes (kelps, macroalgae, seagrasses) from coastal reefs represent a major source of carbon and organic material to beaches.  Changes in the production and input of macrophyte wrack may shift infaunal community biodiversity, structure and dynamics, and alter prey availability to higher trophic levels, such as shorebirds.  Overall species richness and abundance, and the species richness, abundance, and biomass of wrack-associated fauna and selected taxa were significantly correlated with the standing crop of macrophyte wrack.  Wrack-associated macrofauna (amphipods, isopods, and insects) made up an average of >37% of the species present on natural beaches.  The species richness of shorebirds and the abundance of two shorebird species that forage visually, Black-bellied Plovers and Western Snowy Plovers, were positively correlated with the standing crop of wrack and with the abundance of wrack-associated invertebrates.  Grooming with heavy equipment, to remove drift macrophytes and trash, is common on beaches in populated regions.  In Southern California, more than 45% (>160 km) of the sandy beaches are subject to regular grooming, removing tons of macrophyte wrack annually.

However, 40 years of research on this issue proves it to be the most controversial issues in coastal ecosystem studies. We show here that marshes must export a large portion of its CO2 fixation to the ocean based on studies of inorganic carbon mass balances in a marsh-estuarine system as well in its adjacent continental shelf. \r\nRecent air-to-sea CO2 flux measurements at several major continental shelves suggest that shelves may act as a one-way pump and absorb atmospheric CO2 into the ocean. The U.S. South Atlantic Bight (SAB) contrasts these findings in that it acts as a source of CO2 to the atmosphere while simultaneously exporting dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to the open ocean. The shelf-wide heterotrophy and carbon exports in the SAB are subsidized by the export of organic carbon from the abundant intertidal marshes, which are a sink for atmospheric CO2. It is proposed here that the SAB represents a marsh-dominated heterotrophic ocean margin as opposed to river-dominated autotrophic margins. Based on this and other studies, DIC export flux from margins to the open ocean must be significant in the overall global ocean carbon budget.

Changes in its populations as a result of anthropogenic inputs and restoration activities are thus of major concern. In a survey across the Everglades ecosystem sawgrass genotypic diversity has been found at the m<sup> 2</sup>  scale. Thus, despite abundant clonal reproduction, sexual reproduction is important to its population structure. Our work has shown that it is self-compatible but promotes outcrossing with synchronous gender separation within a plant. To assess the efficiency of wind-pollination over time and space, and with respect to environmental factors, four 6 x 6m plots were placed in a natural sawgrass stand in May/June 2002. In each plot, the 2nd, 4th, and 6th flowering nodes of 8 sawgrass plants were enclosed in foil prior to female expansion. On the day of female emergence, plants were unbagged and flowers collected at time 0 and then hourly, until floral desiccation. The number of grains on receptive stigmas was counted using light microscopy. Hourly airborne pollen was assessed using sticky pollen traps placed on dead sawgrass stalks on the 2nd, 4th and 6th nodes. Humidity and temperature were monitored throughout the exposure period. Sawgrass pollen release began between 06:15 and 07:15, while stigmas dried out by ~11:00. Airborne pollen and pollen capture were positively correlated to temperature and negatively correlated to humidity. Across all plots, floral pollen capture varied within plants and between plots. Pollen capture and the likelihood of successful fertilization, however, increased with exposure time. Therefore, sawgrass pollination and seed set are sensitive to daily weather conditions and to the timing of storm events during its flowering season.

In many parts of North America, the build-up of wildland fuels caused by fire management activities over the past 50-100 years have increased the dangers posed by wildland fires. Fuel build-up�either in the form of dead, woody debris or, as is the case in interior Alaska, increasing continuity of flammable forest cover� is undesirable for two reasons. First, it can cause future catastrophic wildland fires; second, it may cause changes in the natural fire regime that adversely affect flora and fauna. An understanding of the processes that control wildland fuel accumulation, including the role that fire management activities play, is crucial for designing wildland management policies. \r\n   \r\nWe developed a spatially explicit model, called Boreal ALFRESCO, which simulates the responses of subarctic and boreal vegetation to transient climatic changes.

Furthermore, it assumes that vegetation composition and continuity serve as a major determinant of large, landscape-level fires. Boreal ALFRESCO operates on an annual time step, in a landscape composed of 1 x 1 km pixels, a scale appropriate for interfacing with mesoscale climate and carbon models.

Research has suggested a link between marsh elevation, tidal inundation frequency, and salt marsh macrophyte productivity.  Frequency and duration of inundation, therefore, may affect macrophyte biomass allocation patterns and overall marsh macrophyte productivity.  An experiment was designed to investigate how varying the marsh platform in relation to mean sea level would affect macrophyte production, stand dynamics, and biomass allocation patterns of Spartina alterniflora, the dominant macrophyte along the US eastern and gulf coasts.  Photosynthesis, pigment analysis, and leaf temperatures were measured concurrently to assess other physiological affects of inundation frequency.  This experiment was replicated in micro- (Cocodrie, LA), meso- (North Inlet, SC) and macro-tidal (Plum Island LTER, MA) salt marshes to further determine how tidal variability also influences macrophyte response.  We found no significant differences among treatments in macrophyte annual production, but highly significant differences in terms of stand densities, plant morphology, and photosynthetic rates.  Our results indicate that frequency of inundation causes a significant variation in stand densities and plant heights.  The highest three treatments had dense stands of shorter stems, whilst the lowest three treatments had fewer culms, and taller average stem heights.  While macrophyte production may not vary with treatment, these changes in stand densities and macrophyte morphology may have profound effects on the ability of the marsh to accrete allochthonous sediments and maintain pace with sea level rise.

For 6 years, we have documented the impacts of altered rainfall patterns (larger rain events with longer inter-rainfall droughts, but no change in total precipitation) in replicated, grassland plots. A central hypothesis underpinning this experiment is that altered rainfall patterns will significantly affect temporal patterns and depth distributions of soil moisture and, thus, plant, community and ecosystem processes. In 2003 we added a warming treatment to assess the interactive consequences of multiple climate change factors. Results to date indicate that more extreme rainfall patterns reduced average soil water content in shallow (0-30 cm) soil layers, but increased temporal variability.

Productivity of the sub-dominant grasses was more responsive to altered rainfall patterns than the dominant C4 grass, Andropogon gerardii.

As environmental degradation or habitat fragmentation occurs, the suitability of islands, habitats, and patches (as well as the ability of individuals to move between islands, habitats, or patches) is affected; this has consequences for the distribution of species across these systems.  At the Konza Prairie Biological Station (a 3500-ha tallgrass prairie site in the LTER system), a mosaic of discrete habitats (ranging in size from 6 ha to 230 ha) has been created by different fire disturbance regimes.  Distributional data have been collected across the site and through time for various taxa, including groups of vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants.  These detailed data enabled us to examine assemblages of different taxa for spatial and temporal structure within the context of a small region.  We examined the relationship between assemblages found in different disturbance-mediated habitats.  Our analyses were based on nested subset theory, in which a suite of assemblages is nested if the species compositions of successively less species-rich assemblages tend to be subsets of those assemblages that are more diverse.  For example, long-term data for small mammals (from 14 local sites over 20 years) were utilized and assemblages exhibited a high degree of nestedness in space and time.  This was true for individual years and sites, as well as for the entire study area and period, suggesting that movements between the habitat islands are important for maintenance of the overall fauna.

These fungi, primarily responsible for lignocellulose degradation in plant litter, are not easily cultured from soil and as such have been greatly under-represented in surveys of soil fungi.  10 g subsamples from soil cores were washed through sieves of 250 and 53 �m mesh to remove bacteria and most fungal spores.

In order to investigate landscape-scale spatial patterns in streamwater Al and DOC, we sampled 7 streams draining the Hubbard Brook valley in central New Hampshire.  We observed considerable variation in stream chemistry both within and between headwater watersheds.  Across the valley, concentrations of total monomeric aluminum (Alm) ranged from below detection limits (<0.7 umol/L) to 22.3 umol/L.  In general, concentrations of Alm decreased as pH increased downslope.  There was a strong relationship between organic monomeric aluminum (Alo) and DOC concentrations (R2 = 0.92), highlighting the importance of DOC in regulating the speciation of Al.  \r\nWe observed the highest Alm concentrations in: i) a watershed characterized by a steep narrow drainage basin and shallow soils, and ii) a watershed characterized by exceptionally deep forest floor soils and high concentrations of DOC.  Forest floor depth and drainage area together explained much of the variation in lnAlm (R2 = 0.79) and lnDOC (0.87).  Linear regression models were moderately successful in predicting Alm and DOC in streams that were not included in model building.  We predicted the lnDOC in streams to within a range of �19 to +6% of observed concentrations, and lnAlm within �23 to +26%.  However, when back-transformed, predicted DOC concentrations were as much as 72% adrift from observed DOC concentrations and Alm were up to 49% off.

These measures, either singly or in combination, describe only a portion of the habitat structure that is important for wildlife. For example, neighborhoods with the same housing density can be landscaped with different kinds of plants.  In our studies of small, residential parks in Phoenix, Arizona, we found that the socioeconomic status (SES) of the neighborhoods around the parks was one of the best predictors of bird community structure within them. Human behaviors, values, and resource consumption levels, which may vary by SES, can influence factors such as the habitat and food availability for other organisms. An advantage of using SES�s over direct measures of the ecological factors influencing biotic communities is that information on SES is widely available. We tested whether human SES showed a similar correlation with avian species richness in parks in two cities: Phoenix and Baltimore, Maryland. We used PRIZM market cluster data to classify the SES of the neighborhoods surrounding the parks. Since PRIZM use the census block group as its geographical unit, we treated the set of block groups immediately surrounding each park as its neighborhood, selecting only parks found in relatively homogeneous neighborhoods with respect to PRIZM market clusters. We found that bird species richness is indeed correlated with SES in both cities, but SES explains much higher proportions of the variance in Phoenix. Birds in Baltimore appear to be less sensitive to differences associated with human SES and more sensitive to overall human density than birds in Phoenix.

Physical forces such as buoyancy, tidal, wind and wave forcing can govern the strength of turbulent mixing.  Because of freshwater input to the estuary, the tidal straining of the horizontal and vertical density field controls the water column stratification, and hence stability, to produce the classical estuarine exchange flows.  Our observations however show that this is not observed during a time of low freshwater discharge (135 m<sup>3</sup>/s) resulting in a net flow of 0.08 m/s seaward, after a time of strong seasonal transport of 1700 m<sup>3</sup>/s in this estuary.  The M2 tidal component creates a very energetic turbulent bottom boundary layer and numerical simulation results show high turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rates, and long turbulent mixing lengths during a period when the water column is unstable.  The turbulent bottom boundary flow characteristics are varied with tidal changes and are also affected by surface waves propagating from offshore during the flood tide.  Wave-current interactions cause an increase of wave radiation stress during flood tide thus presumably enhancing the bottom stress during this time.  Ebb shoaling at the Altamaha River mouth also limits the wave energy communication between the estuary and the open ocean.  The significance of these results in ecological systems is that turbulence plays a key factor in re-supplying nutrients to the water column so that plankton can grow.  Turbulence in bottom boundary layers affects sediment movement, deposition, and re-suspension, and the flux of nutrients out of the benthic boundary layer.

The objective of this research was to assess the direct effects of fire vs. alterations in resource availability (N and light) that accompany fire, as mechanisms that constrain or facilitate shrub (Cornus drummondii) expansion.  The primary effects of fire in 2001-2002 were 100% aboveground mortality of shoots of C. drummondii and removal of the detrital layer.  Post-fire resprouting resulted in ca. a 600% increase in stem density compared to a 200% increase observed in unburned shrub islands.  The addition of a litter layer to burned shrub islands reduced soil temperature and light availability (similar to unburned islands) but stem density still increased by ca. 400%. In contrast, N additions did not influence new stem production or ANPP.  While two years of fire did not impact total ANPP in shrub islands, it did shift the relative abundance of growth forms.  Grass productivity was stimulated by the high light conditions of the post-fire environment while C. drummondii ANPP was reduced.  In unburned shrub islands, C. drummondii ANPP was greatest, whereas a reduction was observed in graminoid ANPP. The persistence of woody vegetation along with a significant reduction in grass ANPP (ca. 30%) suggests that once established, C. drummondii can exclude C4 grasses and that an important ecological threshold has been crossed.

It seems that because of the harsh nature of the arid environment, just removal of shrubs and even subsequent seeding with native or introduced grasses is not enough to reverse the trend.  Several examples are illustrated with historic aerial photography.  A more integrated approach seems to be necessary and particularly one that involves the concentration of water to increase localized soil moisture.  Increased soil moisture alone is not always enough as is evidenced by historic treatments where brush water spreaders and contour terraces were used, although the results of these treatments may have been different if the original treatments had been maintained on a regular basis.  The relatively simple construction of water ponding dikes seems to produce the best result, and the success and persistence of the dikes appears to vary with soil type.  As was observed in nearly all dikes constructed on the Jornada Experimental Range (JRN LTER) in southern New Mexico, immediate results cannot be expected as several large rainfall-runoff events need to occur, usually over a period of years.  The vegetation response of the Jornada dikes is easily seen using air photos, and the vegetation pattern produced is very similar to naturally occurring �banded vegetation�.   Grass response has been positive in all water-ponding dike installations, and it appears that native species in the local seedbank respond better than introduced species.  Well planned installation of these simple structures over a landscape unit may initiate changes that could lead to re-establishment of grass in the desert ecosystem.

An extensive field study was undertaken at the Jornada LTER site in southern New Mexico to understand better and quantify this small-scale variability of key hydrological, sediment and nutrient model parameters. Different parameters for spatially distributed hydrological and soil-erosion models vary and scale in fundamentally different ways. Therefore, common key model parameters have been collected and examined for their parameter-scaling properties. Parameters under investigation include vegetation and pavement cover, ponded infiltration rates and hydraulic conductivity, microtopography, the Darcy-Weisbach friction coefficient, soil moisture, particle size distribution, soil aggregate stability and nutrient content. A nested sampling strategy is used to obtain measurements at a range of different spatial scales from several metres (plant-interspace scale) to the medium-range variations of several tens of metres (shrub patch size). Geostatistical analysis is applied as a scaling tool to estimate the deterministic length scales of these parameters.

In the alpine it is known that topography affects the redistribution of resources.  Trees at treeline are hypothesized to accumulate water nutrients, and organic matter by functioning as snow fences.  These inputs would subsidize the biota in the FATE as they provide moisture, carbon, nitrogen, and base cations to the soil.  This transported material likely includes nitrogen of anthropogenic origin.  These subsidies were hypothesized to be greatest nearest the alpine tundra, the source of the material, and downwind of trees, because of the tree-wind interaction. The goal of this research was to look for indirect evidence for this redistribution by measuring the total pools of carbon and nitrogen, nitrogen cycling rates and resin bag available nitrogen.  Total soil carbon and nitrogen, exchangeable cations, in situ N mineralization, and resin bag available N were measured upwind and downwind of individual trees at three sites within the FATE. Total carbon and nitrogen generally increased with altitude across the ecotone and were higher downwind than upwind of trees.  Resin bag available nitrogen was greater downwind of trees than upwind of trees and decreased with elevation.  The predominant form of nitrogen was nitrate.  Nitrogen mineralization was also lower upwind of trees than downwind of trees, significantly so at the tree island site, and increased with elevation.  At the closed forest site, ammonium was the dominant form of nitrogen produced, but nitrate was more abundant at the higher elevation sites.

Permafrost confines groundwater flow to shallow soil horizons, where organic matter storage and microbial activity are high.

This study assessed mycorrhizal symbiosis under various fire regimes in southern African savannas, ecosystems similarly dominated by perennial C4 grasses and subjected to fire and grazing.  Mycorrhizal root colonization (MRC) and root system architecture (RSA) were studied in 18 grass species across contrasting experimental fire frequency treatments in the Kruger National Park, South Africa.  All species were colonized by AMF, although MRC was variable among species and sites, and generally higher in more nutrient poor sandy soils than on clay soils.

Both mycorrhizal symbiosis and RSA were strongly affected by fire, with an increase in MRC and a decrease in root branching and fine root development with decreasing fire frequency.  Greater water limitation in frequently burned sites may result in greater fine root development and branching, which in turn results in reduced plant dependency on AMF for acquisition of soil resources.  Reduced MRC in frequently burned savanna may also be driven by higher phosphorus availability or P:N ratios, or indirect effects due to higher grazing intensities in frequently burned sites.  Overall, MRC levels in these African savanna grasses were 2 to 3 times greater than grasses in sites of similar soil fertility and precipitation in North American grasslands.

Maintaining high rates of water loss during times of high water availability could allow small plants to take advantage of pulses of water, such as the summer monsoons typical of warm deserts like the Chihuahuan, and thereby become established quickly.  However, a plant cannot endlessly increase water loss in order to grow faster; there are hydraulic constraints on rates of water loss.  The hydraulic properties of a particular soil microsite and plant xylem, as well as the AR:AL (absorbing root area to transpiring leaf area ratio), interact to set limits on rates of water loss. If transpiration rates become too high, cavitation may limit the ability of the soil and xylem to supply water to the leaves.  We tested two hypotheses on small and large plants in a population of Larrea tridentata located at the Sevilleta LTER in central New Mexico: (1) do small plants grow faster and use water less conservatively than large, and (2) are there differences in the hydraulic constraints on small and large plants. Shoot growth, gas exchange and plant and soil water potentials were measured in the field to determine growth rates, water status and water use from April 2002 � August 2003.  Measurements of leaf specific conductance determined the ability of the xylem to supply water to the leaves.  A model (Sperry et. al, 1998) determined the hydraulic constraints on each size based on xylem vulnerability curves and soil texture analysis. Excavation findings were used to estimate (AR:AL) for the model.

Bartonella spp. have recently received increased attention as an emerging human pathogen that may be transmitted by fleas.  Plague is known to cause large scale epizootics of black-tailed prairie dogs, Cynomys ludovicianus, often decimating entire colonies.  To discern what role small rodents and their fleas play in disease transmission within and between rodent hosts, we compared fleas collected from rodents on prairie dog colonies to hosts in similar habitat adjacent to colonies, and habitat dominated by shrubs.  Eighteen flea species were collected from fourteen rodent species and the degree of overlap was noted.  The northern grasshopper mouse, Onychomys leucogaster, was captured in comparatively large numbers on all three habitats.  It was the only rodent that showed significant overlap with other rodents in the fleas it carried (from five other rodent species).

Interactions between climate and ecosystems with complex topographic gradients generate unique source and sink habitats for water and nutrients as a result of precipitation, energy, and chemical redistribution.  High elevation lakes and the alpine tundra-forest ecotone are locations expected to receive the brunt of anthropogenic inputs obtained from the redistribution of exogenous materials from the regional environment, and from endogenous sources originating from other montane areas.

We identified clouds from clear sky by utilizing visible and infrared channel thresholds, then we fit a logit model to the cloud cover. The logit model indicated that the cloud cover probability of a location is closely related to three independent variables: the difference between the elevation and the lifting condensation level, aspect and slope. The coefficients of the three independent variables are significant at a = 0.05. Except on August 2 of 2000 and July 20 of 2001, slope does not contribute statistically significant effect to cloud cover probability at a = 0.05.  The higher the elevation of a location over the lifting condensation level, the higher the probability the cloud cover.

The derived aETs ranged from 0 to 6.86 mm/day with a mean of 2.59 mm/day, correlated with elevations over the LEF. The simulated data were compared with the field measurements of aET using the thermal dissipation probe method at different locations at different elevations and in different forest types. The comparisons showed good agreement in the low and middle elevations but only moderate agreement at high elevations. We discussed the relations between aET and vegetation types using categorical data analysis. The results show that both very high and very low aET occur in the low elevation forest (tabonuco forest), implying that this forest has both the highest mean aET and also the highest variation. The high elevation forest dwarf (or cloud) forest and the palm forest have low aET, and aET at the intermediate elevation (colorado forest) is a little higher than that in the higher elevation forest.   \r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n1.

Most of these studies analyzed tracer test results with transient storage models that assume residence times are distributed exponentially.

Determination of CNU, for both ammonium and nitrate, was obtained by subtracting throughfall (TF) flux from the sum of wet deposition (WD) and dry deposition (DD): CNU = WD+DD-TF.  Canopy N uptake efficiency (CNU/[WD+DD]) for ammonium (0.9) was consistent across the 3 seasons.  For nitrate, this efficiency was 0.8 (2000), 0.7 (2001) and 0.6 (2002).

This evaluation is usually done by comparing the map simulated by the Land Use and Cover Change (LUCC) model to a reference map of the same time. This comparison almost always results in a high level of agreement because of the relatively small amount of change in the landscape over the time period being modeled. Evaluating a model solely on its agreement with a reference map does not result in an informative evaluation of the model&#8217;s ability to predict change. To address this issue, I use a Null model, which assumes that no change occurs over the time period being modeled.  By comparing the Null model to the predictive model, I can determine how accurately the predictive model places the change that does occur.  \r\n	In this analysis the Null model performs better than the predictive model at the resolution of the raw data. As the accuracy of the model is dependent upon the resolution of the data, the analysis is extended over multiple resolutions.

Hi-resolution GPS mapping with cm-scale accuracy is an effective method for detailed geomorphic mapping, illustrating the evolution and destruction of dunes, washover flats, and beach environments. Importing field GPS data into ArcView GIS permits aerial and volumetric calculations to be made of changes within elevational slices of the islands between surveys. During the past 7 years, Myrtle Island has been transformed from a high-profile barrier with dunes over 5 m above MSL (most of the island was between 2-3 m above MSL) to a washover flat with most of the island less than 1 m above MSL.

The majority of these changes have occurred in the absence of major coastal storms, probably influenced by alterations in the longshore drift related to the dynamics of Ship Shoal Inlet and the effects of moderate extratropical storms. More than 400 m of westward retreat of the shoreline has occurred since 1996, averaging about 80 m/yr.

Reforestation of tropical pastures has been proposed as a strategy to help mitigate anthropogenic C emissions. We use a replicated chronosequence of secondary forests of 7 ages ranging from recently abandoned pastures to old-growth forest to examine decadal scale dynamics of soil C in Puerto Rico. We hypothesize that (1) the primary mechanism for soil C storage is the development of a soil aggregate hierarchy; and (2) the hydrophobic content of plant litter will be the best predictor of the formation of stable soil C. Based on delta <sup>13</sup>C data, most pasture-derived soil C (C<sub>4</sub>-C) was lost within the first 20 years of forest regrowth. Soils from 0-10 cm were very stable and insensitive to our method of separating aggregate size classes. An observed trend in increasing C content with aggregate size, however, led us to develop a better separation method that may resolve differences in aggregate size distribution and stability. To test hypothesis 2 we are measuring the production and decomposition of litter along the chronosequence. Preliminary chemical analyses show that pasture roots and leaves contain about one-third the non-polar extractives (NPE) and one-fifth the tannins of forest tissues. There was a 2-fold difference in the NPE (%) and a 9-fold difference in tannins (%) between common tree species.

High eutrophication rates cause an increase in aboveground plant biomass, resulting in increased competition for light.  We hypothesize that there is a trade-off between high nitrogen use efficiency (requiring a long life span) and the ability of plants to reposition leaves in the high light environment of the upper canopy.  Secondly, we hypothesize that eutrophication promotes invasions by favouring a subset of plant species that are highly plastic (both photosynthetically and morphologically), allowing them to capture more light, increase levels of net primary productivity and outcompete other species that are less plastic and cannot increase their productivity levels to the same extent.  Our comparison of morphological and physiological photosynthetic characteristics for a suite of invasive and non-invasive wetland plants shows that the invasive plants abscise lower canopy leaves as new leaves with high photosynthetic rates develop in the upper canopy, whereas the native species alter the physiology of their lower canopy leaves so that they are shade-adapted, with lower maximum photosynthetic rates.

The groundwater spring maintains a relatively constant temperature and discharge throughout the year, whereas the mountain stream is highly dependent on seasonal patterns of precipitation and air temperature.  Measurements of bed disturbance using marked rock movement and estimates of tractive force and particle size distribution suggest that the mountain stream has a more intense disturbance regime than the groundwater spring.  Macroinvertebrate community structure shows dramatic differences in trophic structure between streams, although taxonomic richness was similar (22-24 taxa).

Ninety-five percent of the Alaska boreal forest consists of three species of trees (black spruce 55%, white spruce 25%, and birch 14%) and we have found evidence of decreased radial growth from warming temperatures in all three species of trees on at least some sites. Hundreds of tree disks and cores have been collected from each species to determine climate sensitivity. All sites sampled to date register some form of climate sensitivity from at least some trees and relationships are statistically significant so that predictive empirical relationships of climate on tree growth can be developed for most sites. Interior upland white spruce trees are all consistent in their negative growth response to warming temperature, while black spruce and birch show some mixed sensitivity. The recent find of a high level of climate sensitivity in black spruce in Alaska, along with a number of different climate indices which optimize growth is surprising and indicates that black spruce trees occupy sites with more varied environmental conditions than previously thought. Preliminary studies of Alaska birch show that it too responds to climate depending on site, and although different climate indices optimize growth according to site, summer temperatures appear to have the greatest affect. Future growth of these boreal tree species, derived from these empirical relationships with past temperature, has been developed for 5 GCM scenarios.

Cultivation had an immediate impact on all measured properties: within two weeks we found differences in dissolved organic carbon, inorganic N, trace gas fluxes, and field-moist aggregates. A decline in water-stable aggregates coupled with a shift in the distribution of inter- and intra-aggregate light fraction organic matter likely contributed to changes in carbon dioxide fluxes.  Increased nitrous oxide fluxes following cultivation were closely related to increases in N availability. Cultivation also reduced denitrification enzymes, probably due to rapid aggregate turnover which reduced the frequency and persistence of anaerobic microsites.

Two mechanisms that might explain the nonlinear response in N2O production to incremental N addition are differential uptake of N by the crop and changes in microbial processes responsible for N2O production across the N gradient.

We have recently established an experiment at the KBS LTER in which cropping system diversity is manipulated by varying the number of crops in a row-crop rotation and the use of cover crops.  The twenty experimental treatments in the &#8220;Biodiversity Plots Experiment&#8221; were established in 2000 and span a realistic range of crop diversities including no-crop fallows (spring and fall-tilled), single species monocultures (continuous corn, soybean, and winter wheat), two-crop (corn-soybean, wheat-soybean) and three-crop rotations (corn-soybean-wheat), with and without cover crops.  All treatments are managed without chemical inputs.  We have been monitoring the effects of cropping system diversity on the associate weed communities by sampling the soil seed bank (early May, just after spring crops are planted) and emergent weed community (biomass harvest in late August).  Interestingly, cropping system diversity (e.g. the number of crops in the rotation or use of cover crops) had little effect on weed seed densities, emergent weed biomass, species richness, or species evenness. Multivariate analysis of emergent weed community composition among treatments revealed that weed communities in fall fallows and winter wheat treatments are distinct from those in spring-sown crops and fallows.  These results suggest that initial differences in weed community composition associated with cropping system diversity are driven by differences in tillage time (fall vs. spring) and that the timing of management activities is initially a more important factor than rotational diversity in determining weed community composition and structure in row-crop systems.', 'Michigan State University', 'Friday Evening', 'Saturday  ', NULL, '192.231.113.225', '015', NULL, '2003-07-25 07:18:00', '2003-09-03 15:04:00', 'KBS', NULL, 'YES'),

A number of studies have investigated the relationship between species richness and invasibility at single points in time, but very few have examined the role of evenness, or the dynamics of these relationships across time.  Kellogg Biological Station LTER provides a good system for quantifying such relationships, as species richness and abundance have been monitored over the past 14 years in old fields of varying ages.  In this study, we examined relationships between community invasibility (changes in total and non-native species richness over time), invader impact (relative abundance of non-native species), species richness, biomass, and community evenness in successional communities at KBS.  In early successional fields, total species richness has been increasing and evenness has been decreasing since the fields were last plowed in 1988, though the rates of invasion slowed after the first five years. Communities with high initial evenness had fewer non-native invasions and the higher native species richness over time, though evenness was not generally a good predictor of invasibility.  In the three older successional fields, non-native abundance decreased while native species richness increased over ten years of monitoring. Evenness did not significantly change across the ten years.  These patterns are in contrast to earlier studies that predicted that total species richness and evenness should increase with successional time, and that species richness, evenness, and invasibility are related in predictable ways.

Factors that may be responsible include overfishing, habitat degradation, and disease.

As salinities in Georgia estuaries have been increasing over the past few years due to drought conditions, Hematodinium sp., a lethal parasitic dinoflagellate that infects blue crabs, has been found in a large percentage of Georgia crabs (as high as 50% of crabs sampled in some areas). High prevalence of this parasite is thought to coincide with high estuarine salinity.

Post-drawdown represents the period immediately after recovery of water level due to extreme drought conditions.  Diversity and abundance of primary producers, herbivores, and upper trophic levels changed between the three time periods in each pond.  Greater drawdown appears to favor detritivorous insects over the fishes, and this apparently has a trophic cascade effect.

Stations in triplicate were located along mainland creek, mid-lagoon, and back-barrier island sites. Samples were collected monthly and analyzed for DIN, DON, DOC, DIP and chlorophyll a. The monitoring study occurred during a period of drought, which steadily increased in severity from January 2001 until its peak in August 2002. The drought affected both physical and chemical parameters within the lagoon. Both water temperature and salinity values were lower in 2001 than 2002. The mainland creek salinities exceeded those of the barrier island sites during the summer of 2002, a reversal of the normal salinity gradient across the lagoon.  During both 2001 and 2002, concentrations of all nutrients were generally highest along the mainland border, decreasing with distance across the lagoon for the majority of the year. Nitrate concentrations were highest in spring during 2001, paralleling base flow loadings observed by Stanhope et al. This same seasonal pattern was not observed for NO3- in 2002, most likely as a result of drought conditions. Concentrations of NH4+, DON and DIP in the lagoon tended to peak during summer, corresponding to higher water temperatures and to periods of high organic matter mineralization. Our results suggest that there is an allochthonous source of nitrate, likely groundwater transported from mainland watersheds.

This study quantified base flow nutrient discharge rates from small watersheds with differing degrees of forest cover and determined relationships of nutrient concentrations to various watershed characteristics (i.e., land cover, soil drainage class). We measured monthly dissolved inorganic and organic nutrient concentrations and water discharge rates for one year from fourteen first-order streams along a north/south transect of the Virginia Eastern Shore. Monthly mean nitrate concentrations in northern streams (202.4uM) were significantly higher than in southern streams (114.8uM). Annual flow-weighted mean nitrate concentrations and export rates showed a significant inverse relationship to percent forest cover within southern stream watersheds (r2=0.53, p=0.029, N=9).

In developing MASIF we have adopted a modular approach that allows the coupling of a model to the analysis and mapping framework using either executable model code or raw computer instructions, and the parameters files. We are currently enabling MASIF to accommodate satellite remotely sensing data as a driver to calibrate model predictions during simulation. For example, we use remote sensing information to adjust simulated biomass or LAI output from daily crop growth.  The MASIF environment provides a powerful and flexible environment that allows model analysts to conduct creative regional experiments with either complex or simple regional models. By providing models with a robust user interface, modelers can optimize their efforts and concentrate on model development. We recognize the value of stand-alone and network-based analytical environments for model assessment and application and thus envision the potential to run, analyze, and visualize web-based simulation models.', 'KBS LTER, Michigan State University', 'Saturday Evening', 'Saturday  ', NULL, '35.10.127.149', '018', NULL, '2003-07-25 08:56:00', '2003-09-03 15:05:00', 'KBS', NULL, 'YES'),

Long-term data sets, some collected since 1915, at the Jornada Basin LTER site are invaluable in identifying the factors that have influenced perennial grass dynamics during the course of shrub encroachment.  The data sets include basal cover of perennial grasses in 105 1 x 1 m permanent quadrats set up between 1915-32, and six spatial explanatory variables as GIS layers: pasture stocking rate, monthly precipitation, soil texture, elevation, depth to caliche, and local water re-distribution patterns.  Our results show that upland grass species (black grama, mesa dropseed, and threeawns) went extinct in many quadrats, but playa grasses (tobosa and burrograss) persisted in many quadrats. Persistence of the important forage species, black grama, was related to distance from shrub-dominated communities at the start of the study. During the severe drought in the 1950s, grass basal cover was not affected by any factors under our investigation. Annual growth of grasses responded to short-term precipitation, especially those accumulated from the recent two years.  Basal cover of the grasses responded to precipitation accumulated within the current year to that accumulated within the recent 15 years.

We have hypothesize that sounds also reflect the status of the ecosystems. Many groups of animals produce sound and use acoustic signals to communicate. Patterns of acoustic signals reflect the dynamics of biological, social, and physical systems in the landscape. Changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of acoustic signal patterns reflect changes in those dynamics.

The purposes of this study were to document the Jornada Basin lizard fauna, to determine if those lizards are affected by spatial and temporal variation in rainfall, and to compare the lizard faunas of remnant black grama grassland to desertified desert shrub communities. We used arrays of lizard pitfall traps, and live, capture-release methods to inventory and monitor the populations of 15 lizard species in desert grassland and shrubland environments over a 14-year period. We found that shrubland and grassland communities support distinct lizard species assemblages, yet the one most abundant species, the Side-blotched lizard (Uta stansburiana) was common across all landscapes.

We found no significant temporal relationship between lizard abundance and annual variation in rainfall. We found that the greatest numbers of lizards were present during periods of annual rainfall near the long-term average, not during periods of high or low rainfall. These findings indicate that Jornada Basin lizard population dynamics are linked to evolutionary adaptations to long-term rainfall and ecosystem productivity, not to fluctuations above or below that as we have found for Jornada Basin arthropods.

The increase in carbon export was not accompanied by an increase in the acidity of atmospheric deposition, the latter having remained relatively constant over the study period.  An analysis of the tributaries indicated a positive relationship between area of cropland and stream alkalinity, in contrast to forested sites which showed a strong negative relationship.  Carbon exported to the ocean in the form of alkalinity may represent a previously overlooked and significant sequestration pathway.\r\n	Ground limestone (&#8220;lime&#8221;) amendments, commonly applied in intensive agricultural settings, may be contributing to the alkalinity export and subsequent carbon sequestration noted by Raymond and Cole (2003).  Limestone application represents an anthropogenic transport of carbon from geologic deposits to an actively cycling form that can potentially affect the exchange of carbon dioxide with the atmosphere (Robertson et al. 2000).  As agricultural ecosystems occupy an estimated 11% of the earth&#8217;s land surface, this has significant implications for the integrated greenhouse gas contribution of intensive agriculture.\r\n	However, understanding the effect of liming on CO<sub>2</sub> trace gas fluxes is difficult as two alternative fates of lime amendments are plausible: strong acid weathering (source) and carbonic acid weathering (sink).  The relative importance of these pathways is unknown.  Data from the KBS LTER indicate that both reactions are taking place, and that certain treatment replicates favor the carbonic acid weathering pathway.

Microbial nitrification and denitrification are the predominant sources of atmospheric nitrous oxide; however, their relative importance in this regard has proven elusive.  Such information will be particularly valuable in agricultural environments that can be managed to foster one process or the other.  Our laboratory has investigated the use of isotopomers as a potential indicator of the relative importance of nitrification and denitrification in nitrous oxide production.  The term �isotopomer� refers to not only the isotopic abundance of nitrous oxide (d15N and d18O) but also to the abundance of 15N within each of the nitrogen atoms in this asymmetrical molecule.  Recently, we demonstrated that the isotopomer composition of nitrous oxide provides an understanding of the pathways of production by the nitrifying bacteria Nitrosomonas europaea and Methylococcus capsulatus Bath (Sutka et al., 2003).  We combine these results with experiments using laboratory cultures of whole soil microbes and pure cultures of an nitrous oxide-producing denitrifier, Pseudomonas chlororaphis (ATCC #43928) to demonstrate that the isotopomer fingerprint of nitrous oxide derived from denitrification is unique from that of nitrification.  Furthermore, we have demonstrated that in agricultural soils the consumption of nitrous oxide during denitrification has no effect on site preference.

In this poster we show results from the �flood� year and also consider these data within a historical context.  We present meteorological data to show the wind and temperature regime compared to more �typical� summers in the MCM.  The relatively warm summer temperatures in 01-02 resulted in increased glacier melt, greater than usual stream flow, and subsequent increase in lake levels in closed-basin lakes.  The high stream discharge also resulted in an increased input of dissolved and particulate matter being delivered to the lakes.  The ice covers on the lakes thinned and the moats were more extensive than usual. The high stream discharge brought about changes to the ecosystem including, changes in the distribution of microbial mats within the stream channel, a decrease in primary production within the lake water column of Lake Bonney due to shading effects from greater sediment loads, and an increase in benthic productivity in some lakes due to the thinning of the ice cover.  Isotopic measurements in the water columns of the lakes showed distinct changes related to the large inflow of water.  In addition to changes in hydrology, the soils also experienced an increase in soil moisture, presumable due to the melting of permafrost. Soil moisture increased in long-term monitoring plots throughout MCM, and this increase carried over into the following austral summer. Increases in soil moisture were associated with changes in the abundance and composition of invertebrate communities.

These ecosystems are critically endangered, with, for example, only 0.02% remaining of the original oak savannas of the Midwestern region of North America.  In a series of studies, we examined the belowground ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity of oak savannas, the effect of fire on diversity, and the spatial heterogeneity of ectomycorrhizal fungi as related to distance from trees.  We have found more than 130 unique RFLP-types in belowground sampling.  Although belowground diversity is higher in closed-canopy forests than savanna, frequently-burned savannas contain a number of species of fungi not found in closed-canopy forests.  Therefore, the combination of savanna and closed-canopy forests results in high ecosystem diversity.  In-situ oak seedling bioassays have revealed that oak savannas are spatially heterogeneous in terms of seedling ectomycorrhizal infection, with 64% of root tips infected on seedlings near trees compared with 28% infection distant from trees.  Based on transects at forest / field edges, ectomycorrhizal infection of seedlings remains high up to around 16 m from trees and then abruptly declines.  We hypothesized that niche partitioning by ectomycorrhizal fungi along a distance gradient from trees would contribute to total fungal diversity; however, very limited evidence of niche partitioning was found.

Manipulation of fire frequency at these sites over the last 40 years has resulted in a gradient in vegetation structure ranging from closed canopy oak woodland in unburned sites to oak savanna in frequently burned sites.  Increased fire frequency is also associated with a decrease in litter N concentrations and soil N availability.  Oak litter with a range in initial N concentrations was collected from the sites and placed in litterbags across the soil nutrient gradient.  We deployed a second set of litterbags that receive treatments of fungicide, bactericide, or both to examine the effects of possible microbial interactions in decomposition.  After 7 months, we measured mass loss, litter carbon (C), N, and phosphorous content, and litter microbial biomass.  Soil nutrient availability was measured using ion exchange resin bags throughout the growing season.  Initial analyses of this two-year experiment indicate that both litter stoichiometry and soil nutrient availability may affect rates of decomposition. For untreated litterbags, high N litter decomposed significantly faster than low N litter.  Site nutrient availability was also positively correlated with rates of decomposition, and N immobilization was higher in sites with high soil N availability.  Application of fungicide (but not bactericide) significantly slowed both decomposition and N immobilization, suggesting that rates of decomposition of oak litter at these sites is highly dependent on the immobilization of N by the fungal community.', 'University of Minnesota', 'Saturday Evening', 'Friday    ', NULL, '160.94.213.234', '068', NULL, '2003-07-25 14:08:00', '2003-09-03 15:00:00', 'CDR', NULL, 'YES'),

Barrett', 'Ross Virginia, Diana Wall and Andy Parsons', 'The Antarctic Dry Valleys are among the most extreme soil environments on Earth, supporting simple food webs subsisting on trace concentrations of soil organic matter (SOM) largely derived from legacies of paleo-lake sediments deposited during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). For example, C and N isotope ratios show that SOM is comprised of mixed sources including both ancient and contemporary material, but it is unknown which sources are most important to contemporary food webs. Long term studies indicate that soil biota are limited by C, though sources of organic matter are not obvious. Here we present a synthesis describing dry valley SOM based upon in situ C mineralization, laboratory rate kinetics distinguishing among rapidly cycling and inactive pools, and invertebrate C assimilation rates. Rates of C mineralization are among the lowest reported for terrestrial soils, yet residence times for C are surprisingly short considering that this ecosystem is strongly influenced by legacies carried over from the LGM. Tracer (13C) assimilation suggests that energy flow through nematodes wields a disproportionate influence on C cycling considering their small biomass. However, it is likely that soil metabolism is limited to brief periods of favorable conditions following melt events. Organic matter is well characterized from kinetic studies using a 2 pool model with rapid (<decadal) and slow (centennial) turnover. We propose a simple SOM model describing an active pool coupled with contemporary food webs, and a slow pool derived from legacies of paleo-organic matter.  This model suggests that a slow turnover pool of soil C may be stable over long time scales, while a smaller active pool has more rapid kinetics capable of responding to pulses of favorable physical conditions.

The gas composition within stems is lower in O2 and higher in CO2 than the ambient atmosphere, but it is not known how these native concentrations affect respiration or might contribute to sapwood senescence.  We designed a series of experiments to determine (a) the pattern of O2 contents at different radial depths within stems, (b) rates of cellular respiration under reduced O2, and (c) the potential for elevated CO2 to inhibit respiration.

McKeown', ',Manuel Colunga-Garcia, and Stuart Gage', 'KBS LTER, Michigan State University\r\nThe role of interspecific competition in ecology has been the subject of a long and continuing debate. Hypotheses on the subject range from placing it as the primary driver of community ecology to disregarding it as a force almost entirely. Part of the difficulty in analyzing competition between species is the short term, small scale nature of most ecological research. The use of long-term, landscape level datasets allows analysis of the spatial and temporal characteristics of species interactions, and to begin to quantify certain characteristics such as competition. Populations of Coccinellid adults have been monitored for 14 years at the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site at the Kellogg Biological Station. An array of 210 monitoring sites checked weekly during the field season has yielded a vast database that upon analysis reveals patterns of interaction between different Coccinellid species and their environment. Analysis of the entire coccinellid community revealed that the two dominant are species Coccinella septempunctata and Harmonia axyridis. Both exotic species are able to coexist with a minimum of competitive interactions in the same spatial and behavioral niche due to a temporal separation between their adult phases. Population fluctuations for both species were established for 1994, 1995, 1997, 1998, 2000, and 2001 to show relative abundance. The resultant raster maps were also analyzed to show the level of landscape dominance. This analysis of adult population distribution indicates that Coccinella septempunctata is most active mid season, while Harmonia axyridis is most active late in the growing season. The switch in dominance is also remarkably consistent, occurring in a 100 degree days window each year.', 'Michigan State University', 'Saturday Evening', 'Saturday  ', NULL, '35.10.127.148', '024', NULL, '2003-07-25 15:17:00', '2003-09-03 15:05:00', 'KBS', NULL, 'YES'),

The importance of human disturbance relative to natural disturbance has steadily increased, most rapidly and dramatically following European settlement.  Legacies from the clearing and plowing, grazing, burning, and cutting from the 17th through 19th centuries strongly influence most ecological processes in the region today.  Harvard Forest has been investigating these influences for nearly a century, as exemplified by the famed Land-use History dioramas in the Fisher Museum at Harvard Forest and, more recently, through its research as a National Science Foundation (NSF) Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site.  Virtually every ecological process studied, from vegetation species distribution and wildlife dynamics through carbon and nitrogen cycling, reflects a legacy of land-use history.  \r\n\r\nThe perceived impact of land-use history on forests across the northeast today depends upon the scale at which the landscape is viewed.  At the local scale, differing ownership, use, and time of abandonment of individual parcels create a patchwork of different forest types and ages with sharp edges.  Once established, these patches tend to be maintained by ongoing management differences.  On the other hand, at the regional scale, the pre-settlement distribution of species, largely along gentle climatic gradients, has been altered by common land-use, resulting in a general homogenization of vegetation across the region.  Moreover, there is some paleoecological evidence that human activity may have acted to speed up already established environmental trends.  Separating human and environmental drivers of ecological change requires at least a millennial perspective.

Detling', 'Prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) can have profound impacts on plant communities of grasslands.  In mixed-grass prairies, their grazing reduces canopy height, litter, standing biomass, and grass:forb ratios.  Studies from the mixed-grass prairie are used to make management decisions in all types of grasslands.  However, the effects of prairie dogs in the shortgrass steppe may be different from their effects in the mixed-grass prairie.  The SGS is drier and is dominated by drought resistant species such as blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) that are also resistant to grazing.  Further, colonies on the SGS are subject to periodic extinction and recolonization due to plague, which may serve to temporarily alleviate grazing pressure from prairie dogs.  Since 1997, we have monitored plant community composition, species richness, and biomass on 5 prairie dog towns and 5 uncolonized sites at the SGS-LTER.  Our data include years prior to, during, and after a plague outbreak.  Biomass of blue grama was about 30% lower on prairie dog colonies than at off colony sites.  Similarly, total grass biomass on active colonies was consistently lower than off colonies.  By contrast, forb biomass on active colonies averaged nearly three times more than off the colonies.  While these trends are in the same directions as those observed in mixed grass prairie, the magnitude of the differences between on and off colony sites were considerably less in the shortgrass steppe.  This is further evidence that the SGS is highly adapted to grazing.  Early in 1999, prairie dogs in two of the colonies died off from plague.  By August,1999, graminoid biomass on the extinct colonies had increased to values that were essentially identical to those off the colonies, and forb biomass on extinct towns had decreased to values similar to those off the colonies.

These studies have shown that annual plant cover is higher on kangaroo rat mounds compared to inter-mound areas. However, few studies have addressed the affects of disturbance on the soil seed bank.  Soil seed banks are an important component of the plant community particularly in arid environments. Annual plants have been known to create viable seeds that remain dormant in the soil for many years making their seed bank a persistent one.  A persistent seed bank allows for future recruitment of plants given favorable conditions and could likely have a dramatic impact on the overall species diversity of the community.  Our study addresses the seed bank of the spring annual plant community around these disturbed areas on the Sevilleta.  Our question is: Does the spring annual seed bank differ from the mound area compared to the inter-mound area?

Soda lime (60 g) and sodium hydroxide 0.4M (50ml), separately as methods, were used as the CO2 traps, and blanks were used to account for the atmospheric CO2. Soil CO2 flux (mg/cm2/day) was determined by weight difference for the soda lime and by titration for the sodium hydroxide. Rainfall and plant cover were also measured.

Relative yield was predicted by root length density (the length of roots per volume of soil), a measure of the efficiency of nitrogen acquisition.

First, fruit growers have been politically active from the start. A second factor has been a larger appeal to health in terms of medicinal uses and nutrition. Third, tree fruits are iconized in U.S. culture and routinely celebrated with various forms of agritainment, the use of fruit themes in naming roads and subdivisions, and other seasonal events. Agricultural land use for the general public tends to center around an image of �ruralness� and/or �nature� that is constructing as rolling hills with blooming fruit trees. Fourth, some industries (e.g., baby food) have also perpetuated the extensive presence of tree fruit on the land in SWMI. Lastly, there are other exogenous socio-cultural forces that have influenced fruit production, including new technologies, environmental regulations, labor, and globalization. \r\nTraditionally, it was common for farm households to cultivate and/or gather fruit for the household, and to sell any excess locally. SWMI was formally recognized as the primary area for commercial production by the mid-1800s; it benefits most from the moderating effects of Lake Michigan which delays autumn frosts, provides heavy winter snows that prevent the ground from freezing, and creates relatively warmer air temperatures. The receding glaciers left a rolling terrain that permits cool air drainage, reducing the number and severity of frosts, and sandy, loamy, well-drained soils. The industry takes shape after the opening of the Benton Harbor Fruit Market in 1860 and the Chicago-Lake Michigan Shore rail line in 1871. By 1900 the state of MI had 98 fruit canners. Early French settlers found indigenous plums, crabapple and cherry varieties. Hence, it can be assumed that there were also indigenous insect and disease pests.

Recently, WCR \"behavioral variants\" have been found in areas near the Illinois-Indiana border and in isolated areas in Michigan and Ohio.

Our hypothesis is that the emergence of the WCR behavioral variant is largely caused by regional changes in cultivation practices - earlier planting dates and/or planting of new varieties that are more cold-hardy - which have disrupted the synchronicity between corn phenology and WCR development.

Ecosystem budgets for New Hampshire northern hardwoods show that young stands (<30 y old) mobilize Ca at rapid rates (3.3 to 4.7 g Ca m-2 y-1), based on the rates of Ca export in streamwater and accumulation in vegetation and the forest floor.  In contrast, older stands are in approximate steady state (losing 1 g Ca m-2 y-1). If young stands tap a pool of soil Ca unavailable to older stands, then repeated harvest will not result in rapid Ca depletion, as has been predicted based on rates of export and weathering in older stands.  If, on the other hand, rapid Ca uptake by young stands hastens the depletion of readily available pools, sustainable forestry may be threatened. We have identified apatite (Ca phosphate) at depth in soils at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (65 g Ca/m2 in E and B horizons and 6 g Ca/m2 per cm of depth in the C horizon), based on sequential extractions and P:Ca and Ca:Sr ratios.  We propose that apatite weathering is accelerated in young stands, perhaps because P is more limiting than N shortly after forest disturbance.

As N limitation is a common feature of terrestrial ecosystems, the response of N cycling to these global change factors may shape overall ecosystem response to global change. We examined the consequences of species identity, CO<sub>2</sub> and N addition for gross and net N mineralization rates in a long-term experiment (BioCON) in N-limited grassland plots in central Minnesota. Consistent with previous research, tissue N concentrations were positively correlated with net N mineralization rates across all treatments for monocultures of sixteen different species. In contrast, gross N mineralization rates were negatively correlated with tissue N concentrations. This negative correlation was likely caused by greater productivity of more nitrogen-use-efficient species that supplied more carbon to the soil, and therefore fostered greater rates of gross N mineralization. Since net N mineralization is the difference between gross N mineralization and immobilization, the positive effects of tissue N concentrations on net N mineralization therefore arose from their effects on N immobilization. As the species observed in this experiment showed increases, decreases and no change in tissue N concentration in response to changes in CO<sub>2</sub> and N, species-specific changes in tissue chemistry and their consequences for N immobilization may explain the significant interactions between species, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and N addition on net N mineralization.

The canopy structure may be of particular importance in old growth forests in the Pacific Northwest because they frequently have complex canopies that are heavily-populated with epiphytes. The epiphytes may increase the storage and interception loss of rainfall in old growth forests relative to young stands because of their ability to store many times their mass in water. Hence, differences in canopy structure may ultimately affect the quantity and distribution of water available for trees and herbs in young and old Douglas-fir forests.   Our previous work at the Wind River Canopy Crane Research Forest found young forests to have more than half the canopy storage relative to an old growth stand (young - 1.10 mm, old growth - 3.32 old) and one third the direct throughfall (young � 0.1, old growth � 0.36) even though they have a very similar LAI (LAI = 9.6 �0.5 old and 10 �1 young).  \r\n\r\nOur present work at H.J.

Similarly, average daily production rates over the continental shelf during January varied by a factor of 5, with maximum rates in 1996 and minimum in 1999 (1213 to 247 mgC m-2 d-1, respectively). Spatially, the main variability is along an offshore-onshore gradient that is always present but it is more pronounced during years of higher regional average production.  In addition, the onshore-offshore gradient can more pronounced in the Northern part of the study area (64 S), off Palmer Station, as occurred in 1995-1996, resulting in a North-South gradient with lower values towards the South (68� S), off Marguerite Bay.  This distribution was reversed in 2001-2002 when the onshore-offshore gradient was more pronounced in the South.  The onshore-offshore gradient can be explained by ice edge dynamics that develop perpendicular to the shore during late spring and summer.

The results indicated that the concentration of the macroelement including N, P, K, Ca, and Mg are significantly accumulated in the leaves of dominant tree species growing in the footslope position (p< 0.05), but the concentration of Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn of leaves are not significantly different for vegetations located in different landscapes.

Although swine have never been the dominant component of livestock in southwestern Michigan, they have generally been the second most common.  \r\nAfter 1954, the number of pigs grew sharply, then dropped dramatically between 1904 and 1940.  This was likely due at least in part to the great Depression, and possibly was affected by the reform of the meat packing industry after 1904.  After 1940, however, hogs have been growing steadily, and are now at about the same number that they were in 1884. \r\nInitially hogs were allowed to run freely in the wooded areas of the early farms, grazing on roots, nuts and mast in the forested areas of the farm.  Permanent pig pens led to disease problems, and were replaced by movable pens.  Contemporary facilities are entirely enclosed, have some degree of biosafety, and attempt to minimize the incidence of diseases.  \r\nOver all these changes, the enduring constant has been the manure from the hogs.  When the hogs ran freely, manure was also deposited wherever the animal happened to be.  With the development of confinement systems, manure had to be transported from the pig pens to the fields for incorporation into the soil.  Although manure from confinement operations is stored and composted, environmental threats from volatization and runoff still remain.  \r\nAt the same time, the pressure on rural land for  residential purposes creates conditions where farms and even entire counties have more manure than can be spread safely on the available farmland.  In these conditions, hog farmers have to make deals with other landowners to obtain access to additional land for manure disposal.

To apply this method, it is necessary to know the minimum glucose concentration required to achieve a maximal respiration response.

The objectives of this study were: 1)to determine the amount of glucose needed for maximum microbial stimulation for soils in a lowland moist forest of Puerto Rico, 2)to establish the time necessary for stabilization of the soil sample after  administration of the amendment treatments and 3)to estimate the microbial biomass on the basis of the respiration rate.

The mechanisms and consequences of this process are uncertain and complex.  However, given the current uncertainty in estimates of carbon sequestration associated with woody plant encroachment, research directed at determining the mechanisms and assessing the consequences of this process is necessary to balance the North American carbon budget. The encroachment of creosotebush (Larrea tridentata) is not well understood, and yet it is the most broadly distributed shrub in the arid regions of the Southwest.   We are performing research at the Sevilleta LTER site in central New Mexico, USA, where creosotebush has invaded adjacent Bouteloua sp. grasslands.  The boundary between the shrubland and grassland forms a distinct transition zone that serves as a temporal gradient of woody plant ingress.  Our research addresses the impact of resource islands on the formation of creosotebush patches, the distribution of carbon and nitrogen resources across the ecotone, and the effect resource distributions have on ecotone structure and aboveground biomass.  Currently, we are measuring aboveground biomass for shrubs and grasses as well as C and N concentrations in creosotebush foliar and woody material from shrub patches of various sizes across the transition zone.  We are also measuring C and N concentrations in soils beneath and between creosotebush patches.  Decomposition and N mineralization will be measured to quantify C pools and rates of N cycling in the shrubland ecotone.

Recent evidence suggests that in Ad�lie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) population trends are due in part to interactions between breeding habitat geomorphology and patterns of snow deposition. These findings are relevant to human impact studies because by isolating this natural �landscape� effect on population variability, it may be possible to tease out tourist impacts. \r\n     We investigated tourist effects on Ad�lie penguins by using a hillshade model of Torgersen Island to examine interactions between nesting habitat geomorphology, snow deposition patterns, tourist activities and penguin population trends. The model was developed with a Digital Terrain Model based on aerial photographs that were geo-rectified with static ground surveys. The penguin data included 10 years of breeding population censuses and 4 years of breeding success estimates.  The island has been visited by tourists for nearly three decades, and we used linear regression and discriminant function analyses to test interactions between breeding population change and landscape processes, including the presence of tourists.  \r\n      Results suggest that variability in penguin populations on Torgersen Island is forced primarily by colony aspect and area.

Salt marshes are particularly vulnerable to eutrophication because they receive nutrient inputs from adjacent watersheds. Here we examine the impact of fertilization on two detritivorous snails that feed on litter from two abundant salt marsh plants, Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus, at 19 sites within the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER study area. In control and fertilized plots, densities of both snail species were positively correlated with nitrogen content of live Juncus, but were not correlated with nitrogen content of live Spartina, nitrogen content of litter from either plant species, or plant biomass (live or litter). The two snail species were negatively correlated with each other in each treatment, supporting previous studies suggesting that they compete. Fertilization significantly increased nitrogen content of live plants of both species, but did not affect the nitrogen content of either litter type, perhaps because plants resorbed nutrients from senescing leaves or because litter was in variable states of decay. Fertilization increased the biomass of Spartina litter and decreased the biomass of Juncus litter, but did not alter densities of either snail species, nor did it alter the negative correlation between species. Sites differed strongly in snail numbers, irrespective of experimental treatments.Our results suggest that impacts of eutrophication may not propagate through the food web to affect detritivore densities, possibly because eutrophication may not strongly affect litter quality, or because other factors such as competition and predation may more strongly mediate detritivore densities.', '<sup>1</sup>The University of Georgia, Athens, GA; <sup>2</sup>The University of Georgia Marine Institute, Sapelo Island, GA; <sup>3</sup>The University of Houston, Houston, TX; <sup>4</sup>Belle Baruch Marine Institute, The University of South Carolina, ', 'Friday Evening', 'Friday    ', NULL, '162.39.228.108', '116', NULL, '2003-08-27 20:36:00', '2003-09-03 13:34:00', 'GCE', NULL, 'YES'),

When LAI is measured at a forest ecosystem, LI-COR LAI-2000 is frequently used but relatively expensive and requires open space to measure reference solar radiation. Alternatively, some forest scientists prefer a multi-purposes, consumer-grade digital camera that provides an upward-looking view of forest canopy. Unlike LAI-2000, it is cheap, handy and captures digital images directly. However, little is known about their processing with HemiView software (Canopy analysis software ver.2.1, Delta-T Ltd.) that is necessary to analyze digital canopy images. HemiView software adopts a threshold method in distinguishing canopy opening from foliage. The method has one problem, because LAI estimates depend on threshold values, which are inputted based on researcher\'s experience. Hence, we examined an approach to solve the problem. First, we obtained hemispheric digital images (Nikon Coolpix 900 with LC-ER1 fisheye) and LAI values using LAI-2000 at a KLTER site (Gwangneung Experimental Forest) for a year. Second, similar data were collected at a same site in the daytime, while bright was varied. Then, we tuned thresholds so that fisheye LAI values were consistent with LAI-2000 ones, and related the consequences to the field condition when the images were acquired.

Thresholds were lower in a coniferous forest than in a deciduous forest except for winter season. In the second experiment, thresholds were positively correlated with interior brightness of canopy at the time of image capture.

Recent studies have shown that forest amphibians can decrease the density of their preys, slow down the rate of litter decomposition, and increase the amount of nutrients available for microbes and plants.  The toad, Bufo bankorensis, is an active forager and one of the dominant litter amphibians in Nanjenshan subtropical monsoon forest, an LTER site in Taiwan.  Diet of 180 toads by stomach flushing method consists of prey items from 97 taxonomic families.  Each stomach contains 18 items on average.  The toads eat predominantly ants and termites in the non-monsoon season.  The major preys of the toads involve members of detrital food webs.  We also setup 10 enclosures in an attempt to evaluate the predatory effects of the toad on the processes of litter decomposition.  Mean density and composition of the litter invertebrates in the amphibian-excluded enclosures was similar to those in the control ones.  In addition, mean decay rate in the excluded enclosures was similar to that in the control ones.  Although these results suggest the toad has little effects on the litter invertebrates and the rate of decomposition, our results from tracking the toads in the forest showed that their home range is much larger than the size of the enclosure.

Furthermore, CWD dynamics are often described by mass loss and density loss measurements, which are not direct measures of respiration. In this study, logs and fine woody debris (FWD) were sampled from a mature mixed hardwood stand and an adjacent stand, selectively logged in 2001. Respiration was measured in a closed dynamic chamber with an infrared gas analyzer. Sampling was stratified by four genera (Acer, Quercus, Betula, and conifers), five decay classes and three size classes (2cm&#8804;d<7.5cm, 7.5cm&#8804;d<25cm, 25cm&#8804;d). Respiration was measured year-round from summer 2002 through spring 2003 to estimate an annual carbon flux per area for each stand.\r\n\r\nMultiple linear regression revealed that air temperature, wood moisture content, density, wood moisture content X density, functional group (hardwood versus conifer), and season were the best predictors of respiration. In the mature stand, CWD released 0.33�0.13 MgC ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> and FWD released 0.16�0.09 MgC ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> while in the selectively logged stand, CWD released 1.35�0.24 MgC ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> and FWD released 0.96�0.13 MgC ha<sup>1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. Respiration from CWD and FWD is thus a significant term in NEE estimates (Barford et al. 2001 estimated 2.0�0.4 MgC ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> for this site).

To take full advantage of embedded sensing systems, we often raise sampling to frequencies adequate for capturing the spatio-temporal dynamics of the ecosystem phenomenon in question. However, the increased sampling frequency creates a number of challenges, including (1) demands on embedded system power that cannot be maintained for prolonged periods, and (2) data densities that cannot be analyzed with adequate rapidity using traditional techniques. Some of the analysis issues apply to remotely sensed data as well.\r\n\r\nArtificial intelligence (AI) provides many promising techniques that can be applied to the problems identified above. Specifically, algorithms can be used to detect driving events of interest, and then adjust the sampling frequency in response variables to optimize both data collection and sensor system power consumption. Inherent spatio-temporal correlations among sensors in the embedded system allow for a coordinated approach to sampling that reduces the number of sensors that must be active at all times. For analyzing the resulting large data sets, pattern recognition algorithms allow for the detection of phenomena in the data, even when the system is controlled by a complex collection of seemingly random connections and occurrences. AI techniques also can be used for making decisions based on a combination of \"expert knowledge\" and the data in-hand.\r\n\r\nThrough this workshop, we intend to meet a number of goals.

Although agrarian transformations represent the most pervasive alteration of the Earth\'s terrestrial environment during the past 10,000 years, many conceptualizations of these transformations assume a simple linear model, with change driven by present-day economic, demographic, and technological conditions. This NSF project incorporates a more integrated and long-term cycle: of land-use change affecting landscapes, of altered landscapes affecting ecological processes, and of both influencing the ways in which humans monitor and respond to their surroundings, engendering further cycles of change. \r\n\r\nThis workshop will feature narrative case studies from the six sites, a first step for identifying the prime determinants of long-term dynamics, present-day patterns, and reservoirs of ecological and social resilience. The case studies will describe the geophysical, environmental, and biological settings; pre-European context and dynamics; social, technological, and ecological drivers of agricultural and land-use change; cross-scale interactions over time; and the influence of legacies in social and ecological response. The cross-scale data collection and analyses are expected to demonstrate that some patterns of human-ecological interactions are surprisingly long term, vary across space and time, and are non-linear.\r\n', 'computer projection, an internet connection', 'Sunday All Day', 'Agriculture, land use change, social science, resilience, case study, agriculture, agricultural landscapes, multi-scale', '2003-08-28 20:15:59', '2003-05-30 12:05:03', 'Charles Redman, David Foster, Ann Kinzig, Ted Gragson, Myron Gutmann, Ken Sylvester, Gerad Middendorf, Len Bloomquist, and Alan Rudy', 'Friday', 'PM', NULL, 'mwhite', 'Madison Room'),

Second, we will present examples of ongoing interdisciplinary studies that use remotely sensed data and discuss how the use of these data facilitated interdisciplinary research by informing the questions asked, the data used, and the analyses applied.

The flows that link components may be energy and matter (e.g., associated with food webs, elemental cycles or even water traveling down rivers) or information (e.g., associated with human or non-human interactions).  But do ecological networks involving communication of different flows have common characteristics?  This question has been addressed recently with some successful resolve, but the number of examples for empirical testing of universality has been limited.  The LTER program has the potential to expand the diversity of networks for examination.  This workshop is designed to synthesize results of LTER activities and other selected studies.  It builds on several recent cross-site workshops on network analysis.  A series of workshops was previously organized through the auspices of the LTER Network  Office and the NSF Biocomplexity Initiative.  We present results from these workshops and other studies that exemplify the diversity of ecological networks.  The purpose of the workshop is four-fold to: (1) assess the status of activities in network ecology from these recent workshops, (2) assess the status of similar activities in other ecosystems, (3) continue development of a manuscript based on previous workshops, and (4) begin development of plans for future activities (e.g., proposals, workshops, manuscripts).

These are analogous to species-area relationships except here we ask how the number of species we observe changes as the observation time gets longer.  We recently analyzed data from two grassland sites in Kansas, one the Konza LTER site, and discovered that, at spatial scales that can be sampled in the field, the slope of the time relationship in log-log space is as steep as or steeper than the slope of the corresponding area relationship for that site.  This finding has important basic and applied implications and suggests that single year species counts may not be as informative as we may have assumed.  Our objective for the workshop is to initiate discussion within the long-term research community of species-time-area relationships.  Specifically, we hope that other researchers will have data and results to share and interest in the possibility of initiating a set of long-term observations that will lead to a better understanding of how space and time interact to determine species number.

Variability is a fundamental property of natural systems, and its quantification and interpretation cross boundaries between many different disciplines.  However, our understanding of how the temporal and spatial variability of ecological properties responds to disturbance is incomplete.  Ecologists typically focus on changes in the mean to characterize system response to disturbance, but this may result in the loss of considerable information about the response.  How often do perturbations affect system variability? Is altered variance a useful metric for detecting either direct effects or legacies of disturbance?  What are the best approaches to detect changes in variability at different spatial and temporal scales or levels of organization?  Given the wide variety of natural and anthropogenic disturbances occurring at LTER sites (e.g., hurricanes, drought, fire, eutrophication, exotic invasions, and land-use change) and the broad range of ecological characteristics measured, our network is ideally suited to address such issues.  The workshop will consist of a set of introductory talks followed by a dialogue on the issues, techniques, and available datasets.

We have categorized canopy structure into a system with a finite number of \"canopy space descriptors\". This provides a framework to work at multiple spatial scales and facilitates cross-site comparison of forest structure.  We have also developed a number of database design components, aka templates for efficient handling of complex data for data analysis and visualization. In May 2003, as a proof-of-concept activity, a two-day workshop with five LTER Information Managers, suggested novel cross-site comparisons and syntheses.

However, understanding the role of DOM is difficult if DOM is treated as a single biogeochemical parameter, and not  characterized with enough resolution to detect the influence of different sources and processes. DOM (DOC and DON) consists of a quite complex mixture of organic compounds derived from terrestrial and aquatic sources. The assessment of these sources, its transformations, transport and ultimately its environmental fate is strongly dependent on the chemical characteristics. While identification of individual components can be accomplished for only a small percentage of the DOM, a range of chemical characterization approaches, such as spectroscopic characterization and molecular weight distribution, can be applied to whole DOM or major DOM fractions. Unfortunately, such chemical characteristics often remain unknown due to the fact that analytical methods used can be complex, time consuming and expensive. However, the molecular level data that can be generated may be invaluable in explaining DOM dynamics, its function in the microbial loop, and its overall biogeochemical role in a particular ecosystem. This workshop is intended as a venue to present participants with presently on-going DOM characterization studies at different LTER sites, exchange methods and expertise in DOM analyses, and identify present and future needs for such characterizations as a tool for the better assessment of biogeochemical and ecological processes in the LTER program. \r\n', 'Need overhead and and computer projector and blackboard or alike', 'Saturday AM', 'dissolved organic matter, DOC, DON, analytical methods', '2003-08-28 20:30:40', '2003-06-11 16:37:18', 'Rudolf Jaff�, Diane McKnight, Nagamitsu Maie', 'Sunday', 'PM', NULL, 'rjaffe', 'South Room'),

If nitrate is denitrified, it is removed from the ecosystem and not transported downstream.  Measuring denitrification in flowing waters is difficult because heterogeneity interferes with efforts to scale up results from small incubations to whole ecosystem rates.  Several potential methods exist to measure denitrification.  1) Acetylene-block incubations where the accumulation of N2O indicates denitrification, 2) whole stream releases of 15NO3- and subsequent measurement of rate of formation of 15N2O and 15N2, 3) Measurement of supersaturation of N2 with membrane inlet mass spectrometry and subsequent calculation of denitrification rates with equations similar to those used to compute whole-stream metabolism from O2 flux data, and 4) Molecular methods to assess expression of genes for denitrification.  The strengths and weaknesses of each method will be discussed in short presentations, and a subsequent discussion will be used to coordinate a cross-site research strategy aimed toward design of critical tests of the various methods.

Research on the fate of nitrate in small streams as a function of riparian/land use types is currently underway (LINX II). A looming challenge across all sites will be to synthesize and apply our understanding of nitrogen dynamics from headwater streams to larger and larger rivers and estuaries.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, we will begin by examining several current modeling strategies for nitrogen dynamics in streams.  Process-based, rule-base and black box models have been used for reach scale simulations as well as for initial network models. Participants will discuss the assumptions and challenges involved in scaling up models and processes from headwaters to larger and larger systems. Several examples of nutrient concentrations in headwaters to large rivers will be examined to see to what extent we can predict longitudinal nitrogen concentrations from our hypotheses on the rates of uptake and transformation in streams with differing land uses.

When comparing different LTER sites and levels of organization, it may be possible to identify similarities and differences in structural constraints on processes.  In this workshop we are interested in identifying what structural constraints may limit processes that affect a system?s capacity to recover from stress or disturbances.  For example, at the plant scale, different morphological traits in dominant plants at LTER sites may restrict their physiological function and growth.  At the landscape scale, the comparison of the spatial distribution of patches with different vegetation composition, height and/or standing biomass between LTER sites may also help explain differences in landscape fluxes, such as the redistribution of water and the dispersal of propagules at these sites.  Identifying similarities and differences in these structural constraints between systems and scales could be an important step for increasing our predictive capacity concerning the consequences of climate change or human disturbances.  In this workshop - for which we encourage the participation of graduate students and postdocs - we would like to compare research on structural constraints on ecological processes at a range of scales and in different systems.  These illustrations will help workshop participants to discuss how structure and function are interrelated in their own study systems and allow for planning future collaborative research across LTER sites.

Aspects of temporal variability such as lags, modulation, and temporal cohesion (i.e., synchrony) are essential to understand to properly scale results both in time and well as space.  However, to date more attention has been placed on understanding how to scale in space (probably driven by LTER regionalization efforts) than in time.  Past intersite comparison may have been limited by lack of similar records at sites.  The pioneering work of John Magnuson and others indicates that relative temporal variation allows a very diverse set of variables to be compared.  This workshop will review results from Andrews and North Temperate Lakes on some of these phenomena and then start a discussion on how widely they occur and if there are any general mechanisms that will lead to general scaling rules that can be applied broadly.

The LTER Network now has access to surveys and databases and an infrastructure to measure some key response variables that assist scientists in predicting and measuring ecosystem response to these perturbations.\r\n\r\nPast forest disease impacts such as chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica) that reached its apex in the 1930s and Dutch elm disease (Ceratocystis ulmi) that reached its apex in the 1970s suggest the key variables to measure impacts of an exotic invasive on forest and aquatic ecosystems.
